## UML DIAGRAMS 

### FACTORY PATTERN

Description:

In a restaurant management system, we need to handle different types of orders
(takeaway, dine-in, delivery, etc.). We want a flexible way to create order processing
objects for each type without the client having to know the exact implementation of each one.

### SINGLETON PATTERN

Description:

In this example, the Singleton pattern is used to ensure that there is only 
one instance of the Database class throughout the application, which ensures 
that all parts of the system use the same database connection.

### BUILDER PATTERN

Description:

 In this case in a reporting system, we want to build report objects in a flexible manner
 and with clean syntax, allowing users to specify different report configurations.

### PROTOTYPE PATTERN

Description:

In this case the Prototype design pattern is used to allow the creation of new product instances
(such as laptops and phones) from existing instances, without the client having to know the exact
implementation of how those products are created. This is useful when we want to create objects that
share many properties with an existing prototype, but we need to modify some specific attributes of each instance.
